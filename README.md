Install Pillow with pip:

```bash
$ pip install Pillow
```

Or use **easy_install** for installing [Python Eggs][7] as **pip** does not support them:

```bash
$ easy_install Pillow
```

Or download and extract the [compressed archive from PyPI][8] and inside it run:

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```
